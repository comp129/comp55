# Git Tips

Here are a few things you must know to use Git and not have it
use you.

1. Ensure your team member uses the project I've given you to setup the repository

    - While you may be tempted to use another project or code that
        someone else has done,
        It's best to use the project I've given you as a starting point
        as it has the acm.jar file embedded
        as well as all the hidden details needed to have your teammates checkout the project
        and have it immediately run.

2. Be careful what you commit

    - If you end up using the project that I've provided,
        after the first commit done by the team member setting up the project,
        .project and .classpath should not be present in the commit files.

3. Look at the icons in your project closely: Here is a list of icons
    with filenames that give a partial explanation of what is happening with files in your project.
    **Do note that the following icons are the ones seen in classic eclipse view
    and their appearance changes when using other themes!**

    ![eclipse icon explanations for it](gittips/media/image1.png)

    Some of the most important icons here are the ">" symbol.
    This indicates that the project and subsequently,
    some files (in this case
    ```conflict.txt```,
    ```dirty.txt```,
    and ```partially-staged.txt``` as well as ```folder```)
    are **dirty**,
    which is that they are different than the current head of the repository.
    Normally as soon as you make changes,
    you'll see differences here.

    Next,
    we'll talk about **untracked** files.

    ![untracked explanation git](gittips/media/untracked.png)

    Untracked means that the file is currently not being kept track of in the repository,
    decide whether or not you want to keep track of it.
    If you do,
    then you can add it to the index.

    ![conflict files explanation git](gittips/media/conflict.PNG)

    The last one,
    **conflict**,
    is an important one to take notice of,
    as you'll have to resolve any conflicts there
    before you're allowed to continue contributing to the project.
    It's best if you resolve the conflicts
    by following the steps in Tip #4.

4. If your project isn't being pushed,
   look at the errors that are being given!
   Read what git is telling you.
   Sometimes you'll need to keep committing and then pulling until everything is up to date,
   once you have no more conflicts and you've pulled you should be able to commit and push.

    - Sometimes you're working on your code
    while one of your other team members pushes a later version of the code to the repository.
    If so,
    git won't let you push the code,
    no matter how many times you try,
    until you merge your changes with the changes in the repository.
    To do this,
    after you commit,
    do a pull,
    and most likely you'll get a couple of files that have conflicts in them.
    This means that you'll have to open them up
    and remove the errors and decide what the right piece of code for that area is.
    Once you do that,
    then you'll be able to add the file again to the index and commit again.
    You can then try to push again
    (You can just use the option "push upstream".
    If it won't let you, continue the pull and merge.

    Here is what a conflicting merge looks like:

    ![Egit-0 10-merge-conflict](https://github.com/comp129/comp55/assets/76021136/2ffb97bc-4b48-4e98-a12d-9afdac298a02)

   When there are conflicting merges, this means that you'll have to choose between
   your changes or the changes from the branch you're merging with.
   Typically, you'll select one set of changes but on occasion you may need to select changes from both.
   To get a better understanding of this, you can go to [step 8 of the GitHub Lab](9-Github.html#step-8-martyr--hackslash---commit-and-push-the-same-line).

5. If you're having issues with the repository,
   you can always reset your folder to match the latest version.
   To do this,
   right-click on the project,
   then select ***Team->Resetâ€¦.***
   Make sure to select the remote version or the local version
   of the repository you want to switch to,
   and then select a hard reset,
   which will attempt to replace your entire folder contents with what is in that version.
   Know that if you do a hard reset,
   you will lose any changes you made,
   so only do this as a last resort or if you haven't made changes and just want the latest part.
   This is also useful for when you have a dirty project
   (which you can tell when the greater than sign is present next to the project).

## Java Build Path - Adding a folder of images

When importing your project into Eclipse
there are times when certain folders are not in the java build path.
Let's take for example a media folder containing images for your project
that's not in your java build path.

The console will return an error telling you it cannot find the image.

![Exception stack trace file not found](gittips/media/cannotFindImage.png)

The first thing you want to do is right-click your *project-name* in your project explorer
and click on the *properties*.
You will be greeted with this window:

![eclipse project properties](gittips/media/propertiesPage.png)

1. Click *Java Build Path*
2. Click on the *Source* tab
3. Click on *Add Folder*

Now you are met with the Source Folder Selection
where you can check the folder you want to include and you are done!

![eclipse source folder selection](gittips/media/sourceFolderSelection.png)

## Adding ACM Library

Creating your own project in Eclipse can be pretty easy to do.
But what if you wanted to use certain libraries such as ACM.
To solve this issue, you will need to download jar files.
I will provide the link of where to downlaod the jar file Pacific uses
and how to install it onto your Eclipse project to use.

### 1. Download the acm.jar file

   [Download this specific ACM Jar](acm(5).jar).
   This jar has been modified from the original ACM jar to work with later versions of Java.

### 2. Adding acm.jar file

   Now, open the eclipse project you want to add *acm.jar* to
   and ***right click*** directly on the project from the *Project Explorer*.
   Then, select ***Build Path->Configure Build Path***.
   If that is not available make sure it is a java project.

   ![Context Menu showing Configure Build Path Option in Eclipse](gittips/media/ClickBuildPath.png)

   Then you would want to click on classpath and add external jar.

   ![Eclipse Build Path Window showing options for adding Jar Buttons](gittips/media/AddingJarButtons.png)

   Depending on where you store your downloads on Mac or Windows,
   click on the downloaded *acm.jar* file and it should
   automatically appear under the classpath as the image below.
   Then all you have to do is apply and close
   and it should be in your project under the *Referenced Libraries* folder.

   ![Eclipse Build path window showing acm jar added](gittips/media/AddedJar.png)

   ![Eclipse Project Explorer showing acm.jar in list](gittips/media/FinishedAdding.png)

### 3. Alternative

   There is an alternative from downloading the acm.jar and then putting it in your project.
   Just make an empty gradle project and start from there.
   Before we do all of that work, you need to understand what a gradle project is.

   An example is like a carpenter.
   He has all of these tools.
   These tools make doing the job faster, easier, and more efficient.
   Think of **build tools** as the same thing but for software development.

   Some examples of these build tools are *Apache Ant*, *Apache Maven*,
   but the one we will be using or integrating today is *Gradle*.
   **Gradle** is an open-source build automation tool.
   It is known as the successor to Apache Ant and Maven.
   To learn more about Gradle, visit its
   [Office User Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html)

   ###Checking if you have Gradle

   I will show you now how to create the Gradle project onto your project.
   On Eclipse and depending on your previous
   tasks you cna have Gradle already installed. So go to File and New. Then go down to Other.

   ###Install Gradle

   You should see a window. In the search bar, you want to search up Gradle.
   That shows you do have gradle installed.
   If not go to Help and then Eclipse Marketplace.

![Help Menu Option from Eclipse showing Eclipse Marketplace](https://github.com/comp129/comp55/assets/239024/9a7baa1e-9b0c-424a-be4c-242af0a9abad)

   Then search `gradle` in the top search bar and download ***Buildship Gradle 3.0***.
   Once installed, you should be able to use Gradle.
   Then when you import any project such as the labs for comp 55,
   you will have access to creating a Gradle project.

   ###Creating Gradle Project

   All you have to do now is click on ***File -> New -> Project***
   Then in the search bar, you will enter `gradle`.
   Click on ***Gradle project***.
   Then ***enter your project name*** and click ***Next***.
   No need to override any settings, just click ***Next***.
   The project should start to load in now.
   All you need to press is ***Finish***.
   One problem that occurs is that your project at first appears inside of a lib folder,
   which makes things more complicated.
   We will leave it for now.
   However, what we will want to do is include the acm library in our *build.gradle* file.
   Using the *Project Explorer* pane, copy and paste *acm.jar*
   into your new Gradle Project's folder to the same directory as your *build.gradle* file.
   Now, add this line to the dependencies section of your *build.gradle*:
   `implementation files('acm.jar')`
   That's all that is needed for gradle to know about that file.
   Many of a build tool's benefits occur
   with having a central place to download libraries and versions.
   This allows you to merely specify as a list what you need in *build.gradle*
   and gradle will fetch the right library.

   As one final example, if you want to use javaFx (which is needed for the AudioPlayer class).
   You don't need to download any libraries, you merely add this line to the `plugins` section:
   `id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'`

   And then add this other set of options (shown in picture below)
   outside of any section and as its own independent section in *build.gradle*
   ![image](https://github.com/comp129/comp55/assets/239024/05289d85-1639-4993-af08-c523c6ab7521)
   Any time you make changes to your gradle project,
   Just save and ***refresh gradle project***, and wait a little bit and watch libraries
   magically appear!
   Build tools are a modern way to develop large applications
   and are good tool to know about as you code more in the future!
